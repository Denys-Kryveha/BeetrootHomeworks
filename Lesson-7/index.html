            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
              Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
              looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to their
              own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the
              documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

            <h2>Core Components</h2>

            <p>
              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform&apos;s native
              capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform&apos;s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and
              behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable,
              nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section.
              But first, let&apos;s cover how components work in React Native.

            <h2>React Fundamentals</h2>

            <p>
              React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for
              building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of
              React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
              can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>

            <p>We&apos;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>

            <p>
              <span class="strong_text"> &plus; components.</span> The rest of
              this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
              approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="strong_text"> &plus; JSX.</span> React and React
              Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
              JavaScript like so: &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your
              cat!&lt;/Text&gt;. The React docs have a comprehensive guide to
              JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
              you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for
              the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside
              &lt;Text&gt;.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="strong_text"> &plus; props.</span> Props is short for
              &quot;properties&quot;.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="strong_text"> &plus; state.</span> While you can
              think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
              render, state is like a component&apos;s personal data storage.
              State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
              comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
            </p>

          <section id="handling_text_input">
            <div class="line"></div>

            <h2>Handling Text Input</h2>

            <p>
              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called
              every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
              takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, let&apos;s say that as the user types, you&apos;re
              translating their words into a different language. In this new
              language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
              sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçïüçïüçï".
